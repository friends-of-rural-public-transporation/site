<p><strong>Part I: Should Orcas Island (and SJC communities) have Public
Transit?</strong></p>
<p>I believe we should explore creating a public transit system for our
island community. I’d love to hear your thoughts and have a constructive
discussion about this possibility.</p>
<p><strong>My Proposal: A Summer Transit Pilot</strong></p>
<p>I suggest we start with a pilot program during our busiest summer
months when the impact would be greatest. This would allow us to: -
Demonstrate the value of public transit when demand is highest - Reduce
vehicle traffic on ferries during peak season - Learn what works before
developing a solution for to year-round service</p>
<p>I envision three routes to ensure frequent, reliable service: East,
West, and Central routes. This three-route system is crucial - we need
hourly service to all major destinations to create a system people will
actually use.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Benefits to Our Community</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reduced Ferry Congestion</strong>: More foot passengers
could mean fewer vehicles competing for ferry space during busy times.
Land-based transportation is orders of magnitude cheaper than ferry
service. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT),
which oversees WSF, could significantly impact ferry congestion at
relatively low cost by investing in this transit pilot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local Mobility</strong>: Residents without vehicles
(including youth and those unable to drive) would have reliable
transportation options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Connection</strong>: Public transit creates
opportunities for neighbors and visitors to share experiences and
connect. Riding together fosters community in ways that driving alone
cannot - whether it’s a chance conversation, helping someone with
directions, or simply sharing in the rhythm of island life. Many of us
might venture out more often knowing we can leave the car at home and
enjoy the journey alongside others in our community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating a Transit Backbone</strong>: Public transit
would provide a backbone system that complements and enhances existing
services like Island Rides. Island Rides provides essential door-to-door
service for our vulnerable population - a critical service that must
continue. A public transit system would work in cooperation with Island
Rides by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the overall transit map with fixed routes</li>
<li>Extending available transit hours in our community</li>
<li>Providing additional options that could free up Island Rides
capacity for those who need door-to-door service most</li>
<li>Creating connection points where the two services could
coordinate</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A Practical Approach Using Existing Resources</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that RCW 28A.160.120 allows resource sharing with
public schools for transit services. Wakiakum County - a similarly small
county - successfully operates transit this way <strong>without creating
a Transportation Benefits District</strong>.</p>
<p>This approach would: - Use existing school vehicles during off-hours
through the RCW 28A.160.120 provision - Minimize startup costs - Allow
us to apply for state and federal transit funding - Avoid immediate need
for new taxation structures or creating an MTA</p>
<p>This may not be achievable for the upcomming 2026 year. But might
there be a possibility regarding a resource sharing solution perhaps in
2027 ??</p>
<p><strong>We Already Pay for Transit - Let’s Get Our Share</strong></p>
<p>We already pay gas taxes and contribute to the Climate Commitment
Act, which specifically funds public transit systems. For example, our
neighboring Skagit Transit benefits from these funds while operating one
of the largest transit networks in the state. It seems reasonable to
ask: shouldn’t San Juan County receive some of this funding to test a
transit system?</p>
<p>Our county transportation plan draft acknowledges that we’re the only
county in Washington without public transit service. We can change this
using the same proven approach as Wakiakum County.</p>
<p><strong>An Incremental Approach: Walking Before Running</strong></p>
<p>To our electrification advocates (Team OPALCO and others) - I invite
you to channel your energy into helping our school district procure
electric vehicles while supporting public transit TODAY using existing
resources. Consider this:</p>
<p>A subsidized electric Tesla sitting in someone’s driveway is idle
80-90% of the time. Meanwhile, a public transit vehicle - even if diesel
today - serves dozens of people daily, reduces overall emissions by
taking cars off the road, and creates a shared community resource.</p>
<p>Which approach better serves our climate goals: - Individual electric
vehicles used occasionally by one household? - Shared transit vehicles
(transitioning to electric over time) that reduce total vehicle miles
traveled?</p>
<p>An incremental, stepwise approach gets us there faster: 1. Create the
transit system now with existing vehicles 2. Demonstrate ridership and
value 3. Transition to electric as funding and technology allow 4. End
up with a highly utilized, shared, electric transit system</p>
<p>Isn’t progress today better than perfection someday?</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Test It Properly</strong></p>
<p>If there’s skepticism about ridership, isn’t it reasonable to seek
funding for a proper test? An adequate pilot means: - Three routes
covering East, West, and Central areas - Hourly service intervals
minimum - Access to all major destinations - Running during our busiest
season when impact would be greatest</p>
<p><strong>Questions for Discussion</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What concerns do you have about public transit on Orcas?</li>
<li>What routes or stops would be most valuable to you?</li>
<li>How might we ensure the service meets diverse community needs?</li>
<li>How can we prioritize shared resources over individual
subsidies?</li>
<li>What’s the most efficient use of our climate-focused tax dollars -
individual or shared transportation solutions?</li>
<li>How can electrification advocates and transit advocates work
together toward our common goals?</li>
<li>Given that we already contribute to transit funding through taxes,
how can we best advocate for our fair share?</li>
</ol>
<p>San Juan County is currently the only county in Washington without
public transit. I believe we can change that through thoughtful planning
and community collaboration, without needing to create a Metropolitan
Transit District.</p>
<p>I welcome all perspectives on this topic. What are your thoughts on
creating a transit pilot for our island?</p>
