<h1 class="title">A Community Conversation on Island Transportation</h1>
</header>
<p>The following letter, originally sent to Island Rides and local
transportation officials, raises questions about Orcas Island’s
transportation future that deserve community-wide discussion. Rather
than keeping this conversation limited to government agencies and
nonprofits, Friends of Rural Public Transportation has chosen to share
these thoughts publicly—inviting all of us to consider how we might
build a transportation system that serves residents, manages visitor
impacts, and protects what makes our island special. Whether you rely on
existing services, have concerns about traffic and environmental
impacts, or simply care about the future of our community, this letter
touches issues that affect us all. Please read on and consider joining
this important conversation.</p>
<p>Dear Island Rides CC WSDOT, SJC, RTAP,</p>
<p>Thank you for your detailed response. I am following up on our
information request and your last email, and I’m attaching the Human
Services Transportation Plan for your review. While some may interpret
this plan as having already addressed public transportation feasibility,
I believe there’s value in exploring this further.</p>
<p>To provide context for our discussion, some sources approximate Orcas
Island’s year-round population as 5,000 residents, swelling to over
10,000 during summer months. The WSF provides comprehensive ridership
data through the Orcas terminal (links included below), which I’ve been
analyzing alongside visitor data from our marinas—including Deer Harbor,
which services approximately 140 vessels daily during peak season. This
is just one of three major marinas serving our island community.</p>

ridership data reports</a> <a
href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wsferries/viz/WSF-Public/Index">Ferry
ridership data dashboard</a></p>
<p>As an island accessible only by water or air, Orcas naturally
functions as a transportation exchange point. This unique geography
presents both challenges and opportunities for creating efficient
transportation networks.</p>
<p>I appreciate Island Rides’ commitment to electrified transportation
and its environmental benefits. I would respectfully suggest, however,
that public transit represents a complementary—not competing—solution
for carbon reduction. A well-organized public transit pilot, regardless
of technological medium, would provide invaluable data about feasibility
and environmental impact.</p>
<p>While I look forward to innovations that may transform public
transit—imagine the impact of passenger-safe, self-driving buses and
shuttles on transportation networks—we cannot afford to wait for perfect
solutions that remain years away. Delaying a public transit pilot today
in anticipation of future technologies may cause us to miss critical
opportunities to address current needs and gather essential operational
data. The perfect must not become the enemy of the good.</p>
<p>When considering transportation efficiency, we should examine the
full cost-benefit equation. For instance, subsidizing walk-on passenger
fares combined with partial public transit subsidies may prove more
cost-effective than subsidizing vehicle fares across the WSF.</p>
<p>I understand your concerns about increased visitor traffic. I share
this concern and believe county planners should consider measures such
as limiting vacation rentals. However, I ask you to also consider the
concentrated carbon and road use impact of thousands of visitors
arriving in a limited timeframe. Public transit could encourage more
ecologically responsible tourism—even visitors who arrive by car might
utilize public transit here. In particular if we encourage the use of
such transit.</p>
<p>Regarding financial sustainability, creative solutions exist. Could
we implement a tiered fare structure where visitors, who often expect
higher costs while traveling, pay premium rates? This may seem
impossible at first. However, could the county subsidize verified
resident fares or offer season passes? These approaches align with our
shared environmental values while building the efficient transportation
networks needed to reduce overall vehicle traffic.</p>
<p>The factors at stake extend beyond logistics—they encompass societal
equity, environmental stewardship, financial sustainability, and human
opportunity. Our goal should be developing transportation solutions that
benefit Orcas Island first, but also considering Washington State, and
ultimately our nation. This calls for an integrated perspective—one that
weighs these interdependent factors not in isolation, but as parts of a
larger whole.</p>
<p>I’ve submitted seperate information requests to the parties CC’d
here: Island Rides, SJC for road use metrics, and WSDOT for additional
ferry use metrics. My aim in collecting information is building a
comprehensive public information database to support informed
decision-making and maximize our collective human opportunity. I’m also
looking for research regarding existing studies on passenger exchange
rates (with and without vehicles) to inform route planning.</p>
<p>I would welcome the opportunity to meet with your team to discuss our
information requests and explore collaboration. Your community-driven
rideshare program represents genuine innovation—particularly noteworthy
because it emerged from public, not private, initiative. The
electrification of your service is indeed the right technology at the
right time and place.</p>
<p>While door-to-door service for our most vulnerable residents remains
essential, I believe it represents one component of a comprehensive
transportation solution rather than the solution itself. To continue the
spirit of innovation.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing this important dialogue.</p>
