<p><strong>Opinion: Orcas
Needs Good Enough Public Transit Today</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context: Developing Solutions for Our Community</strong></p>
<p>We believe residents should have choices—both in whether to raise
additional taxes for enhanced service and in selecting among different
implementation approaches.</p>
<p>In that regard, our transit planning groups need to develop and
refine multiple transit plans, not settle on a single solution. These
plans should be presented and considered by our community. As the
Friends of Rural Public Transit, our initial proposal aimed to provide
the county with an adequate transit pilot program that would not raise
the local tax base <a href="https://theorcasonian.com/guest-opinion-should-orcas-island-and-sjc-communities-have-public-transit/">
ForPT.org Proposal</a>
</p>  
<p>However, we don’t believe it’s the only path forward.</p>
<p><strong>The Urgency is Real</strong></p>
<p>Every year we delay implementing public transit is another year of:
<ul>  
<li>Limited mobility for non-drivers, including seniors and youth </li>
<li>Continued isolation for community members without reliable transportation </li>
<li>Missed opportunities to reduce our collective carbon footprint </li>
<li>Increased personal vehicle use (predominantly fossil-fueled) </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Our community deserves transit solutions today, not just visions of
what might work tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment: Evaluating a Proposed Solution for Public Transit
on Orcas Island</strong></p>
<p>For three years, I’ve advocated for public transit on Orcas Island
that meets what I call the “AAA requirements”: <strong>Affordable,
Accessible, and Available</strong> service for our community. Today, we
have Climate Commitment Act gas tax funding that could have launched a
transit pilot program . Yet we continue to wait, pursuing an electric
vehicle vision that may delay real transit solutions for years.</p>
<p><strong>What Effective Transit Requires</strong></p>
<p>Any suggested public transit system plan for Orcas should analyze
iteslf employing the AAA service requirements. As an example our plan
translated the requirements into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three routes covering the island’s key destinations: Central, East,
and West</li>
<li>Hourly service intervals throughout the day</li>
<li>Approximately 12 hours of daily operation</li>
<li>Strategic stops at community hubs like the Senior Center, providing
vital connections for our elderly residents</li>
<li>Summer capacity requiring a bus (Central) and perhaps two
15-passenger vans (East and West), with backups for reliable
service</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t wishful thinking—they’re the constraints any viable
solution must address.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost Reality: Understanding the True
Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Through preliminary analysis, we’ve identified that the most
significant expenses in Public Transit are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Staff salaries (drivers)</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure/vehicle purchase costs (capital
expenditure)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our proposed solution addressed these constraints through resource
sharing with Public Schools, targeting one of the largest cost drivers
while avoiding new taxes. The “bright idea” in that plan has potential
to demonstrate a transit pilot quickly and affordably, using existing
resources. This could give us valuable information in planning an
ultimatly more catered approach when we understand how the system was
utilized. Moreover, this partnership would benefit our schools by
generating revenue from their underutilized resources turning idle
assets into income that supports education.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting, Not Replacing, Existing Services</strong></p>
<p>Let me be clear: I fully support Island Rides’ vital door-to-door
service for community members who need it most. I applaud them regarding
that development. Their work is essential. But let’s recognize that
Public transit would actually strengthen their mission by providing a
complementary service network, helping them focus resources on those
with the greatest mobility needs.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Electric Vehicle Plan Falls Short</strong></p>
<p>The plan being developed by Island Rides <a
href="https://issuu.com/utilitypioneers/docs/ruralite_orcas_power_light_october_2025">OPALCO
Ruralite Magazine P.8 , Oct 2025</a> assumes electric vehicles will
reduce maintenance and fuel costs. While this may be accurate for
electric cars, these savings are today overshadowed by the underlying 
infrastructure requirements including charging stations and vehicle
purchase costs.</p>
<p>Several factors make this approach impractical at this time (
although I welcome factual evidence to the contrary ):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Operational Limitations</strong>: Running electric buses
and perhaps even vans continuously for 12 hours daily isn’t currently
practical. The limited deployment of electric buses, shuttles, and vans
in public transit systems elsewhere confirms this technology
gap.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local Experience</strong>: Multiple sources report that
Orcas’s electric school bus has been a maintenance nightmare .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased Capital Requirements</strong>: Meeting our
three-route requirement with electric vehicles would necessitate
purchasing additional vehicles due to charging downtime, significantly
increasing capital expenditure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Affordability Crisis</strong>: The electric approach
drives costs up, undermining what should be a core benefit—public
transit that’s affordably attractive to residents. Without
affordability, people will not use the service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sticker Shock</strong>: Electric buses, vans, and
infrastructure carry a substantial price premium over conventional
vehicles—a capital cost burden that may directly contradict our core
mission of providing AAA transit.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A Pragmatic Path Forward</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t about opposing electrification—it’s about not letting
perfect become the enemy of good. We should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attempt to Find a More Immediate Solution</strong>:
Implement a public transit pilot using proven, currently available
technology and existing funding </li> 
<li></li><strong>Give Residents
Choices</strong>: Develop multiple transit plans—including tax-neutral
options alongside proposals requiring voter approval</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobilizing Our Community: A Call for Creative
Solutions</strong></p>
<p>While our proposed partnership with Public Schools offered one path
to resource sharing, we recognize this approach may not be feasible this
coming year. That shouldn’t stop us. This is where our community’s
creativity and collective resources can make the difference.</p>
<p>I’m calling on all groups and organizations that support public
transit— transportation collectives, environmental groups, senior
services, youth organizations, business associations, religious
organizations, and concerned citizens—to come together and explore
creative solutions. We need to pool our resources, share our expertise,
and find innovative ways to launch a pilot program sooner rather than
later.</p>
<p>The Climate Commitment Act funding provides a foundation, but
community investment—whether through time, resources, or creative
problem-solving—could be what gets us a viable solution. We don’t need
to wait for a perfect government solution which never comes or idealized
technology without a timeline. We need people in our community willing
to step up and say, “How can we help make this happen now?”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Keep Exploring Options</strong></p>
<p>The current electric vehicle plan appears to be an inadequate
solution that fails on both accessibility and affordability. It will
likely delay implementation of any adequate public transit system. Even
if implemented, based on the information provided. It will likely not
meet “good enough” AAA requirements creating a Transit Solution that our
community needs. The technology simply isn’t mature enough to meet our
requirements at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>We need to continue developing alternative plans, and present them to
our community. Plans with real choices—including tax-neutral options
alongside proposals that might require voter-approved tax-based funding.
But most importantly, we need people and community organizations to
actively participate in creating solutions rather than waiting for them
to appear.</p>
<p>The goal should be finding Public Transit solutions that work for
Orcas, not waiting for and forcing premature technology adoption that
serves neither accessibility nor affordability goals. With community
support and creative resource sharing, we can launch a pilot transit
program that serves our island’s needs today while building toward
tomorrow’s possibilities.</p>
